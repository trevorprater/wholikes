This rudimentary script yielded my most popular creation on Dec 25, 2015, resulting in many millions of views from around the globe. Please do not judge my abilities or skill-level by this script, instead, I hope you enjoy the art for what it is.

It is worth noting that the nodes with no connections represent 75,000 fake instagram accounts that I created before generating this image.
